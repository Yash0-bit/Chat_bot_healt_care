## Introduction

This project is a submission for the task assigned by Kratin LLC. We have created a simple chatbot designed to assist elderly individuals with common health issues. The chatbot can help users identify potential health problems based on their reported symptoms and provide precautionary measures.

## Implementation

### Machine Learning
We have leveraged machine learning to implement the core functionality of the chatbot. Specifically, we used a Decision Tree Classifier to predict potential health issues based on input symptoms. The model was trained on a dataset of symptoms and corresponding diagnoses.

### Gradio for Web Deployment  (current deployment)
To make the chatbot accessible to users through a web interface, we employed Gradio. Gradio is a Python library that simplifies the creation of web-based machine learning interfaces. With Gradio, users can easily input their symptoms and receive health-related recommendations from the chatbot.
This is current working model with file name that contain code (healthcare_bot.py)

### Flask Deployment (Work in Progress)
We are actively working on deploying this model using Flask to provide a more scalable and production-ready solution. Flask will allow us to create a robust web application that can handle a larger user base and additional features.
